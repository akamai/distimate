========================

Distimate allows to you to analyze distribution of an arbitrary large populations using constant memory.
Distributions are stored as histograms with predefined bucket edges.

Distribution histograms can be collected incrementally or aggregated from smaller samples.

Distimate can estimate common statistical function from the histograms.


When a histogram is known (e.g. loaded from database), it is possible
to compute CDF (cumulative distribution function) or estimate percentiles
of the distribution.
